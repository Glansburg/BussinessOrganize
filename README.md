# BussinessOrganize

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my own bussiness organizer as a challenge with some co-worker names and job titles.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* how to work with .env files for security of user data.
* How to set up tables.
* How to set up queries.
* How to set up seed files.
* More practice with inquirer.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* Not finishing inquirer part of project.
* Took me a long time to figure out how to set up foreign keys/ queries.
*  Not having enough time to finish project but it was fun.
